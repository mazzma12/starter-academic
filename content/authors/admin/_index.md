I enjoy working with large datasets of various type (satellite images and GIS data mostly) to solve complex problems. Recently I focused closely on Copernicus' constellation and the possibility to study methane emissions at a global scale.   

Beside work, I am passionate about traveling and climbing. I spent a year abroad in Sweden studying in Lund and 2 months in Moscow interning in a small venture company. 

In this blog I intend to share posts of various kind, and not only focused on data science...
